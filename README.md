# 16D-Lattice-outputs-unicode-code-points
In this updated version, I have defined the dimensions vector as { 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 } to create a 16D lattice with each dimension set to 2. You can modify the dimensions vector to create a higher-dimensional lattice with the desired dimensions.
